# dsp-research

Contains random projects related to the Electrosmith Daisy platform that I am researching to learn more about Digital Signal Processing.

## The Goal

Through this project along with supplementary learning I am attempting to take up music technology as a hobby. I am learning both the code and the theory through a combination of Electrosmith's Daisy Platform and by reading textbooks about DSP.

## Projects

### Own Blink

A simple example that blinks the LED

### Encoder Test

Changes the LED color through use of the encoder.

### First Sound

Makes a simple oscillator that outputs a constant frequency.

### Random Synth

A synth that has FM synthesis and plays a random note.

### Sample and Hold

Holds a given input signal for a certain number of samples.

## Terms of Use

Right now, feel free to read through the code but it is for personal use as I learn, not for commercial.

I learn more, I hope to begin to release some DSP related Open Source Projects and maybe make a guitar pedal or a Eurorack module, but for now, that is only a dream.
