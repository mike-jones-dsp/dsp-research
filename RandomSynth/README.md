# RandomSynth

## Description

This is a synthesizer that I am building using the Electrosmith Daisy Pod that plays a random note whenever a button is pressed.

It has FM synthesis that is added in by changing the value of the knobs and the ability to change waveforms by turning the encoder.

Each time button1 is pressed the synth chooses a random note in the range A2-A4 and then plays it as long as the note is held, accounting for the attack and decay envelope.
